# TechEX (CLI) — Python Version
   ```bash
     _____       _    _____  __
    |_   _|__ __| |_ | __\ \/ /

   ```
   
This folder contains the original Python CLI version of TechEX. It’s a simple command‑line interface.
The web app in `web/` supersedes it, but this remains as a useful reference and utility set.

## What’s here
- `main.py` — CLI entrypoint
- `functions.py` — core functions and utilities

## Run
```bash
cd python
python main.py
```
Follow the on‑screen menu to perform actions.

## Relationship to the web app
- The Flask app in `web/` is the modern UI and user experience.
- The CLI here showcases similar logic without a web server or database.

## When to use this
- Quick testing of logic without running the full web stack
- Examples for unit tests or scripts
